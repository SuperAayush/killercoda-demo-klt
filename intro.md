The Keptn Lifecycle Toolkit is a tool and vendor-neutral mechanism - it does not depend on particular GitOps tooling - ArgoCD, Flux, Gitlab or others - KLT works with them all.

The Keptn Lifecycle Toolkit emits signals at every stage (k8s events, OpenTelemetry metrics and traces) to ensure your deployments are observable.
